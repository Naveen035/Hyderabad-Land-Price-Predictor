## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. **Web Scraping** 🕸️
- **Source**: Data was collected from [NoBroker](https://www.nobroker.in/blog/property-rates-in-hyderabad/) using **BeautifulSoup** and **Requests** libraries.
- **Objective**: Extracted details of land prices and locality information.

### 2. **Data Cleaning** 🧹
- **Data Handling**: Processed the scraped data to remove null values, duplicates, and handled outliers.
- **Encoding**: Used **Label Encoding** for categorical features (e.g., locations).
- **Feature Engineering**: Created additional features as needed for improved model performance.

### 3. **Data Visualization** 📈
- **Tools Used**: Visualizations were created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to explore relationships between variables.
- **Key Visuals**:
  - Distribution plots for price per square foot.
  - Bar charts comparing prices in various localities.
  - Heatmaps showing correlations between features.

### 4. **Machine Learning Model** 🤖
- **Model Used**: Trained a regression model using **Scikit-learn** to predict the land price based on input features (location and area).
- **Preprocessing**:
  - **Label Encoding** for categorical data.
  - **Feature Scaling** where necessary.
- **Model Evaluation**: Used metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **R-squared** to validate the model's performance.

### 5. **Deployment** 🚀
- **Platform**: Deployed the app using **Streamlit**, making it accessible through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Interactive Features**:
  - Users can select a location from a dropdown.
  - Input the area in square feet.
  - View predicted prices dynamically.
